			<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Antsy McClain's podcast unwisely revisits the painful, awkward moments that keep us up at night, and offers no answers - just the sweet but impotent act of commiseration. Co-hosted with his longtime friend and musical collaborator, Chris "Spoons" Long, Resisting Enlightenment stumbles toward wisdom even while we seem to be doing our damndest to avoid learning anything at all from the experience. Mixed with humor, heart, a little music and just the right amount of insight, Resisting Enlightenment wants you to know you're not alone in being a dumbass. You don't have to be an Antsy McClain or Trailer Park Troubadours fan to enjoy Resisting Enlightenment, but we're betting you will be after you hang out for awhile.</p>]]></itunes:summary>
